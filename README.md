Github issues fetcher for assigned issues or mentions of a particular user
* This app filters out assigned issues or the issues where the user is mentioned together.
* This is needed when a user wants to know where he has been mentioned plus he needs issues which are assigned to him. * For now users have to query for the assigned issues first and then for the mentions. 
* There is a filter 'involves' which takes into account everything, i.e. every issue where user has commented, has been mentioned, has been assigned, is author.
